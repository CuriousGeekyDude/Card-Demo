# Card-Demo

## About
This is a simple card shuffling demo.

### Gameplay mechanics
Cards are randomly shuffled. You have to pick 2 cards at a time. If they match, the front card won't be activated and consequently the cards stay revealed until the end of the game.
However, if there is a mismatch then the front card is reactivated and the chosen cards are again hidden from sight. You have to continue doing
this until you have found all the similar cards. Then you win. The "Won:" label will be incremented by one each time that you win. The "Games:" label will only be 
incremented if you win a game or click on the start button which restarts the game altogether. The following are 3 screenshots from the 
game:
