# Card-Demo

## About
This is a simple card demo. Cards are randomly shuffled. You have to pick 2 cards at a time. If they match, the front card won't be activated.
However, if there is a mismatch then the front card is reactivated and the chosen cards are again hidden from sight. You have to continue doing
this until you have found all the similar cards. Then you win. The win: label will be incremented by one if you win. The Games: label will be 
incremented if you win a game or you click on the start button which restarts the game altogether. The following are 3 screenshots from the 
game:
